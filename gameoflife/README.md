## Game of Life
The game of a life is a cellular automation created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It follows very simple rules, as stated below:
1. If an alive cell has more than 3 neighbors, it dies of overpopulation
2. If an alive cell has less than 2 neighbors, it dies of underpopulation
3. If an alive cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, it lives on
4. If a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbors, it becomes alive from reproduction
